## Scripts for pipelines, coverage extraction

AlignedToGenome - given a bam file with aligned reads, extract the exons regions and output bp coverage. This step is however SLOW since the aligners look for multimapping regions         
GenesOnly - given an assembly and annotation, extract the coding regions and align the gene reads. Extract the coverage only of those
