## Minutes spruce meeting

### 10th Augustus, 1pm Mendel room
Present: Rene, Inanc, Austin, Lauren, Kristina, Hamid

### Inanc paper outline

Intro
- Joerg, Jean-Bousquet co-leads on SpruceUp project 
- Recapitutale on the spruce species: WS77111, Q903 and Interior PG29. This paper is not going to contain Engelman spruce 
- What makes the species adapted to the environment and their phenotypes 
- Target is Nature plants

Figures, display items

* Intro
	* Map of spruce geographical ranges and marked samples loci
	* Phylogenetic tree: tree and outgroups. Representation of ambiguity. Assemblies as a starting point but we can look at the genes or organellar genomes

* Genomics resources
	* Genomes and intro - table with statistics
	* Transcriptomes and annotations
	* Genetic map (version 1 only?)

* Comparative genomics
	* Hive plots or other plots, gene families. Use genome assembly and annotation mainly, SNP calling too. 
Whener there is a missing gene in one of the species use the kmers coverage to check for existence 
	* Hive plot or other plots for repeats
	* Repeats families classification - CD-hit
	* S/NS changes in genes of interest or common genes

* Defence genes
	* Motifs
	* Gene structure
* alt4) Regulatory motifs 
	* cis regulatory elements
	*Cis- regulatory from Kollector, check reconstruction in the ~7000 Kollector genes. Check if something interesting.

* AMP plants?

- Follow up meeting 23rd August with Jean Bousquet
- Phylogenetics tree - ask Shaun for turning Abyss-bloom to tree
- Lauren - we can feed the info into existing tools. Use plasmids to select contigs, no need to re-assemble other peoples assemblies. Use both plasmids and genes. 
- Rene - Mash on the genes and genomes in phylogeny
- Hamid - we have tools for phylogeny, other based on gapped space seeds, new development possible
- Austin: challenging part is the 3 and we need input from collaborators for the 1b and 4.
- Kristina - checking for display images, coordination
