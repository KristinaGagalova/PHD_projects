# Analysis of reduced complexity in cDNA after cdhit

- CovIdentity: plot identity vs query coverage of all-vs-all alignment, check if any pattern is present to set a cut off threshold for the 2 values
- PlotMulteplicityBlastAlign__diffTh: plot the number of hits per query in 4 data sets which have been processed with CD-HIT. Apply different thresholds of identity and coverage before showing multiplicity. 
- PlotMulteplicityBlastAlignHCG-GM_diffTh: same analysis of multiplicity as in  PlotMulteplicityBlastAlign__diffTh. Data set is high confidence genes and genetic map. Different thresholds of coverage and identity. Analysis of sequences lenght is also included
